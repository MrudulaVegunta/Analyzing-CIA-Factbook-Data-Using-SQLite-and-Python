# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQLite-and-Python


In this  mini project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:

'population' - The population as of 2015;
'population_growth' - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage;
'area' - The total land and water area.

We downloaded the SQLite database, 'factbook.db'. In this project, we'll explore the Python SQLite workflow to explore, analyze, and visualize data from this database.
